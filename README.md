# NYCIslandora
NYCIslandora is a local community of Islandora users that meet to discuss successes and challenges of using Islandora. If youâ€™re working in Islandora, thinking about it, or just curious, then join NYCIslandora at one of our monthly meetups.  It is an opportunity to bring together local New York City information professionals working to create and build cultural heritage collections using Islandora.

## Conveners
* Robin Naughton, The New York Academy of Medicine
* Diego Pino Navarro, Metropolitan New York Library Council


## Meetings
Started in January 2017, the group meets once per month for two hours, generally around the second week of the month. 

Meeting locations rotate among the members of the group.  Each member has an opportunity to host a meeting at his/her institution.
